## Purpose

The Calculator is a web application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. It was built as a way to practice design skills and improve proficiency in DOM manipulation and function integration.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of the Basic Calculator was to create a functional calculator that could be used by others. This project was an opportunity to create a useful tool that could be accessed easily and used for everyday mathematical tasks. I have used this calculator on numerous occasions when doing simple math for my classes at UBC.

## Tech Stack

The Calculator was built using the following technologies:

-   HTML: A markup language used for creating web pages and web applications
-   CSS: A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML
-   JavaScript: A programming language used for adding interactivity and functionality to web pages and web applications

## Features

The Calculator includes the following features:

-   Basic math operations: Users can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo using the calculator.
-   Clean design: The calculator has a clean and aesthetically pleasing design, making it easy to use and visually appealing.

## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building the Basic Calculator was the challenge of ensuring that the calculator is functional and performs the necessary operations correctly. This involved testing and debugging the code to ensure that the calculator works as expected.

## Accomplishments

By building the Calculator, I achieved a number of accomplishments, including:

-   Practicing design skills and improving the visual appeal of the calculator
-   Improving proficiency in DOM manipulation and function integration
-   Creating a functional web application that can be used by others

## Future Changes

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Basic Calculator in the future. Some potential improvements could include:

-   Adding additional math operations such as square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions
-   Improving the design and layout of the calculator
-   Adding support for mobile devices and optimizing the layout for smaller screens
-   Implementing a history feature that allows users to view past calculations and results.
